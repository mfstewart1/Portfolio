              <p><img class="img-style-1" src="assets/images/Michael Stewart.jpg" alt="Headshotpic" width="113" height="150">Hello. My name is Michael Stewart. I am part of the Fall 2020 class at University of Arkansas at Little Rock, majoring in Information Science. I am a Navy Veteran, serving five years. During my time in the Navy, I was a Computer Network Specialist. I installed network software and cables, repaired network cables, including fiber optics, and I also troubleshooted network problems, among other tasks. I am currently working on my CCNA Certification, with hopes of receiving it around the time I graduate in the Fall. I would like to obtain a position in computer networking to get my foot in the door. After graduating with my degree, my next goal is to gain certifications in Cybersecurity.</p>
